What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When a repository is initialized, a ".git" folder is created in the current folder.
    ".git" folder contains metadata for the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area offers an intermediate step between working directory and repository. It allows to easily separate in more than one commit all the new file added to the working directory, which could be logically separated (e.g. some file for a functionality, other files for another functionality, ecc.)
